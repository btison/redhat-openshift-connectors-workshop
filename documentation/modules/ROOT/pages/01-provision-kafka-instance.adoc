= Provision a Kafka instance in {product-long-kafka}

As a developer of applications and services, you can use {product-long-kafka} to create and set up Kafka instances and connect your applications and services to these instances. {product-kafka} is a managed cloud service that enables you to add Kafka data-streaming functionality in your applications without having to install, configure, run, and maintain your own Kafka clusters.

In this section of the lab you provision an instance of {product-long-kafka} and configure it for use with {product-long-connectors}

[#redhat_account]
== Create a Red Hat account

[NOTE]
====
Skip to the link:#kafka[Provision a Kafka Instance] section if you already have a Red Hat Account.
====


You need a Red Hat account to provision a managed Kafka instance. This is how you can create one: 

. Go to https://console.redhat.com[console.redhat.com]. 

. Click the *Register for a Red Hat account* link to create a Red Hat account.

+
Be sure to select a *Personal account* type.
. Complete the registration process, opening confirmation emails if necessary.

[#kafka]
== Provision a Kafka instance in OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka

. Go to https://console.redhat.com[console.redhat.com] and log in with your Red Hat account.

. On the https://console.redhat.com[console.redhat.com] landing page, select *Application and Data Services* from the menu on the left.

. On the Application and Data Services landing page, select *Streams for Apache Kafka â†’ Kafka Instances*.

. On the Kafka Instances overview page, click the *Create Kafka instance* button. Enter a unique name and select the relevant _Cloud region_ for your Kafka instance and click *Create instance*. This starts the provisioning process for your Kafka instance. 

. The new Kafka instance is listed in the instances table. After a couple of minutes, your instance should be marked as ready. 
+

. When the instance _Status_ is _Ready_, you can start using the Kafka instance. You can use the *Options* icon (three vertical dots) to view, connect to, or delete the instance as needed.

[#configure_kafka]
== Configure the {product-kafka} instance for use with {product-long-connectors}

After you create a {product-kafka} instance, configure it for use with {product-long-connectors} by performing the following tasks:

* Create *Kafka topics* to store messages sent by producers (data sources) and make them available to consumers (data sinks).
* Create *service accounts* that allow you to connect and authenticate your {product-connectors-short} with Kafka instances.
* Set up *access rules* for the service accounts that define how your {product-connectors-short} can access and use the associated Kafka instance topics.

{nbsp}

. Create a Kafka topic for your connectors:
.. In the Application and Data Services page on https://console.redhat.com[console.redhat.com], select *Streams for Apache Kafka* > *Kafka Instances*.
.. Click the name of the {product-kafka} instance that you created for connectors.
.. Select the *Topics* tab, and then click *Create topic*, and follow the guided steps to define the topic details. Click *Next* to complete each step and click *Finish* to complete the setup.
+

+
* *Topic name*: Type a unique name for your topic. For example, type `test-topic`.
* Accept the default settings for partitions, message retention, and replicas.

. Create a service account for your connectors:
.. In the Application and Data Services page on https://console.redhat.com[console.redhat.com], select *Service Accounts*, and then click *Create service account*.
.. Type a unique service account name (for example, *connectors* ) and then click *Create*.
.. Copy the generated *Client ID* and *Client Secret* to a secure location. You'll use these credentials to configure connections to the Kafka instance.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The generated credentials are displayed only one time, so ensure that you've successfully and securely saved the copied credentials before closing the credentials window. 
====
.. Select the *I have copied the client ID and secret* option, and then click *Close*.

. Set the level of access for your new service account in the Access Control List (ACL) of the Kafka instance:
.. In the Application and Data Services page on https://console.redhat.com[console.redhat.com], select *Streams for Apache Kafka* > *Kafka Instances*.
.. Click the name of the {product-kafka} instance that you created for connectors.
.. Click the *Access* tab to view the current ACL for this instance.
+
image::rhosak-default-access.png[]
.. Click *Manage access*.
.. From the *Account* drop-down menu, select the service account that you previously created, and then click *Next*.
.. Under *Assign Permissions*, click *Add permission*.
.. From the drop-down menu, select *Consume from a topic*. Set all resource identifiers to `is` and all identifier values to `"*"`.
.. From the *Add permission* drop-down menu, select *Produce to a topic*. Set all resource identifiers to `is` and all identifier values to `"*"`.
+
The `is "*"` settings enable connectors that are configured with the service account credentials to produce and consume messages in any topic in the Kafka instance.
+
image::rhosak-manage-access.png[]
. Click *Save* to add the permissions for the service account. +
The ACL for your Kafka instance should look like:

Your {product-kafka} instance is now configured to be used by {product-connectors}.
